To run the bot
1. open the server (ctf1_for_x86)
2. open the python file (Bot.py) and run
the bot will now open and guess the pin

Once the bot has found the right pin
Open your browser
type "127.0.0.1:8888" and the server will open its interface 
Finally, type the right pin given by the bot





I started to open the server then looked at the instructions it has a clue that the pin is just number.
Then i created a python bot that loops all the number from 000 to 999 and connect it to the server.
I learned that the port was 8888 becuase I searched the internet the command for cmd to know where the server is listening.
